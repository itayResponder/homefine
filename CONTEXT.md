# HomeFine — Project Context

## What is this?
A multi-household finance manager SPA. Users create "households", invite others via link, and track shared expenses/income. Built with React + TypeScript + Firebase Realtime Database.

## Tech Stack
- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 8
- React Router v7 (SPA, no basename)
- Firebase: Auth (Google OAuth) + Realtime Database + Hosting
- CSS: plain per-component files, no framework
- Font: Plus Jakarta Sans

## Firebase Project
- Project ID: homefine-a7613 (check .env for current)
- Hosting: homefine-a7613.web.app
- Realtime DB: europe-west1 region

## Authentication
Any Google account can sign in. Access control is enforced server-side via Firebase Security Rules (`database.rules.json`). Household data is accessible only to approved members (`userHouseholds/{uid}/{householdId} = true`). Joining a household requires an invite link + owner approval.

## Pages
| Route | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | LandingPage | Marketing page |
| `/dashboard` | DashboardPage | Household list, create/join |
| `/join/:householdId` | JoinPage | Sends join request (owner must approve) |
| `/app/:householdId` | AppPage | Finance app (כספים) — all finance views |
| `/app/:householdId/home` | HouseholdPage | Household management (ניהול משק בית) — tasks + shopping |

## AppPage Views (pills nav)
- **סיכום** — per-member summary cards + recent transactions
- **הוצאות** — inline add form + all expenses for month
- **הכנסות** — inline add form + all income for month (hidden if expensesOnly)
- **[member name]** — per-member stats + expenses + income (X button to delete)
- **חיובים קבועים** — recurring charges management
- **לוגים** — change history (via settings gear → dropdown)
- **הגדרות** — member management (chips list + remove), income privacy, owner controls, color theme, export. Add-member form was moved out of Settings to the pills `+` button modal.

## Key Hooks
| Hook | Args | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `useAuth` | — | Google login + whitelist |
| `useHouseholds` | uid | User's household list |
| `useMembers` | householdId | Members CRUD |
| `useTransactions` | householdId | Transactions CRUD |
| `useRecurring` | householdId | Recurring charges CRUD |
| `useLogs` | householdId | Audit log |
| `usePresence` | householdId, user | Online users |
| `useHouseholdMeta` | householdId, uid | Meta + isOwner + settings |
| `useJoinRequests` | ownedHouseholds[] | Join requests for owned households |
| `useMemberName` | — | Locale-aware member name display |
| `useUserColor` | uid | Per-user primary color (localStorage + Firebase) |

Participants are managed inline in AppPage (no dedicated hook) — subscribeParticipants + seedParticipant called directly.

## Permission Model
- **Owner** (`meta.ownerId === user.uid`): can rename household, toggle expenses-only mode, see join requests
- **Member**: can toggle own income privacy (`member.privateIncome`)
- **Join request flow**: JoinPage → creates request → owner approves/denies via notification bell

## Data Types (key)
```typescript
Member: { id, name, nameEn?, color, createdAt, userId?, privateIncome? }
Transaction: { id, type, amount, description, category, memberId, date, createdAt, recurringId? }
RecurringCharge: { id, description, amount, type, category, dayOfMonth, startYearMonth, monthCount, memberId, active }
HouseholdMeta: { name, ownerId, createdAt, settings?: { expensesOnly? } }
JoinRequest: { uid, name, email, photoURL?, ts, householdId, householdName }
```

## TransactionCategory (19 values)
rent, electricity, water, gas, internet, mobile, property_tax, food, entertainment, health, clothing, transport, education, baby, loan, salary, bills, nela, other

## What's Built
- ✅ Full multi-household support with invite links
- ✅ Real-time sync (Firebase onValue)
- ✅ Hebrew (RTL) + English (LTR) i18n
- ✅ Per-user color theming
- ✅ Custom styled select + date picker components
- ✅ 19 transaction categories with icons
- ✅ Recurring charges (auto-apply monthly)
- ✅ Audit logs with diff tracking
- ✅ Online presence tracking
- ✅ Owner controls (rename, expenses-only mode)
- ✅ Income privacy per member (client-side)
- ✅ Join request flow with approval/denial
- ✅ Notification bell (AppHeader + Dashboard, shared component)
- ✅ Member cards with bilingual names (he + en)
- ✅ Delete member → cascades to transactions + recurring
- ✅ Participant management — owner sees "גישה לבית" in SettingsView with photo/name/email/join date; can revoke access (removes userHouseholds + participants entry, keeps data). Each member seeds their own participant entry on app load (Security Rules allow member self-write to their own participants/{uid}).
- ✅ Membership guard in AppPage — subscribes to `userHouseholds/{uid}/{householdId}`; redirects to /dashboard if user is removed mid-session or accesses a household URL without permission.
- ✅ Real-time dashboard update on removal — fixed `useHouseholds` bug where `rebuild()` wasn't called after removing a household from `metaMap`, causing the dashboard card to persist until refresh.
- ✅ Leave household — non-owner members see "עזוב בית" in the ⚙️ header menu; removes userHouseholds + participants entry, redirects to dashboard.
- ✅ Delete household — owner sees ✕ button on dashboard cards; confirms → removes all members' access → deletes entire household node. Security Rule added at `households/$householdId` level for owner full-write.
- ✅ Brand color — `--brand: #2563EB` defined in `index.css :root`; JoinPage logo + button use `var(--brand)`; `DEFAULT_COLOR` updated to `#2563EB` in `color.ts` and `SettingsView.tsx`.
- ✅ HeroCard shows actual household name (meta.name) instead of hardcoded string
- ✅ privateIncome filtering applied consistently — HeroCard + MemberView now receive `currentUserId` and filter private income of other members (same logic as SummaryView)
- ✅ Firebase Security Rules — whitelist removed from code; access controlled server-side via `database.rules.json` (deployed to homefine-a7613-default-rtdb)

## Firebase Security Rules (database.rules.json)
- Any authenticated Google user can log in and read household `meta` (needed for JoinPage)
- Household data (members/transactions/logs/etc.) readable/writable only by approved members (`userHouseholds/{uid}/{householdId} = true`)
- Only the owner can manage `joinRequests` and `participants`
- Users can create their own join request; owner approves/denies
- Users can remove themselves from a household (delete their own `userHouseholds` entry)
- Deploy: `firebase deploy --only database`

- ✅ Landing page updated — CTA changed from "התחל בחינם/Start for Free" → "התחל עכשיו/Get Started"; stats updated (removed "חינם/Free", added "מרובה/Multi" — manage multiple households); feature 6 updated from whitelist → invite link + owner approval description; bottom CTA desc updated; hero mockup replaced with real locale-aware screenshots (`/screenshot-he.png`, `/screenshot-en.png` — switches automatically by language).
- ✅ Member card auto-created on household creation — DashboardPage creation form now collects owner name (Hebrew required, English optional); card created via `addMember` from `firebase/db` immediately after household creation with color `#6C63FF`.
- ✅ Add member via pills `+` button — `AddMemberModal.tsx` opens from AppNav's `＋` pill (after member pills). Add-member form removed from SettingsView; member chips list remains there for deletion only.
- ✅ Logo colors fixed & consistent everywhere — "Home" = `#0F172A` (dark), "Fine" = `#2563EB` (blue). Previously DashboardPage used `var(--ac)` (theme-dependent) and JoinPage used `var(--brand)` for the wrong part. App.tsx + AppPage.tsx loaders also had colors inverted. All now match LandingPage and AppHeader.

- ✅ Home module (tasks + shopping) — module switcher כספים/בית above content. Tasks grouped by room with condition bar (fresh/medium/due/overdue based on days-since-done ratio). Auto-rotation among members. Shopping list with real-time sync, one-tap toggle, clear done. Firebase paths: `tasks/` + `shoppingItems/` under household. Components: `src/components/home/` tree. Hooks: `useTasks`, `useShoppingList`. DB: `src/firebase/homeDb.ts`. Types: `src/types/home.ts`. Constants: `src/constants/rooms.ts`. Utils: `src/utils/taskUrgency.ts`. i18n: `t.home.*` section added to all three files.
- ✅ addTask error handling — `HomeView` now catches Firebase write failures and shows a toast (`t.home.addTaskError`). Root cause of silent failures: `database.rules.json` must be deployed with `firebase deploy --only database` for `tasks` + `shoppingItems` paths to be active in production.
- ✅ Two-app architecture — AppPage (כספים, `/app/:householdId`) and HouseholdPage (ניהול משק בית, `/app/:householdId/home`) are separate routes. AppHeader is shared and contains a fixed-color (#2563EB) navbar with two pills: כספים / ניהול משק בית. AppHeader uses `useLocation` + `useNavigate` internally; receives `householdId` prop. `onOpenSettings` and `onOpenLogs` are now optional props — AppPage passes both, HouseholdPage passes neither (future: household settings). Both pages have auth guard via `subscribeUserMembership`. HouseholdPage renders HomeView (tasks + shopping sub-tabs). AppPage no longer has module switcher or HomeView.
- ✅ Kanban board (tasks) — Three **vertical groups** (Monday.com style): צריך לבצע / בתהליך / בוצע, each collapsible. Drag-and-drop via `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable` (PointerSensor + TouchSensor). Supports intra-group reorder (saves `order` field to Firebase via `batchUpdateTaskOrders` multi-path update) and inter-group move (changes `status`). Local state managed with `useRef(dragActive)` to avoid Firebase flicker during drag. Moving to "בתהליך" sets `startedAt`, moving to "בוצע" sets `lastDoneAt` + rotates. Task type: `status?`, `dueDate?`, `estimatedDays?`, `startedAt?`, `order?`. KanbanCard uses `useSortable`. `TaskGroup` (KanbanColumn.tsx) uses `SortableContext` + `useDroppable`. AddTaskModal has optional due date + estimated days fields. **Pending: `firebase deploy --only database` for tasks/shoppingItems rules.**
- ✅ Kanban UI polish — KanbanCard left stripe color follows group status (`kc-card--todo/in-progress/done`), not urgency. Group "בתהליך" colors use `var(--ac)` / `var(--acl)` / `var(--acd)` (follows user theme). KanbanCard shows expanded details: frequency (🔄), estimated days (⏱), due date (📅), and footer row with creator name + creation date. Edit button (✎) on card opens **EditTaskModal** — prefilled with all fields + status selector; saving calls `moveStatus` if status changed (handles timestamps) + `updateTask` for other fields. INTERVALS array moved to `src/constants/tasks.ts` (shared between AddTaskModal + EditTaskModal). New i18n keys in `t.home`: `editTask`, `editTaskTitle`, `statusLabel`, `createdByLabel`, `createdOnLabel`, `estimatedDaysUnit`.
- ✅ AddTaskModal UI consistency — replaced native `<select>` and `<input type="date">` with `CustomSelect` and `CustomDatePicker`. Modal CSS fixed: `overflow: visible` + `max-height: none` on `.ap-modal.atm-modal` (higher specificity) so dropdowns/calendar escape the scroll container. Overlay scrolls on small screens instead of modal. `openUp` prop added to `CustomDatePicker` (calendar opens upward, `bottom: calc(100% + 4px)`). Mobile: 96vw width, larger calendar tap targets, stacked footer buttons.

## What's Planned / Not Yet Built
- ❌ Super Admin panel (metadata only, for app owner)
- ❌ Viewer role (read-only member)
- ❌ True server-side income privacy (E2E encryption or Firestore rules)
