# HomeFine — Project Context

## What is this?
Multi-household finance manager SPA. React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Firebase Realtime Database (not Firestore).

## Firebase Project
- Project ID: homefine-a7613 (check .env for current)
- Hosting: homefine-a7613.web.app — Realtime DB: europe-west1

## Pages
| Route | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | LandingPage | Marketing page |
| `/dashboard` | DashboardPage | Household list, create/join |
| `/join/:householdId` | JoinPage | Sends join request (owner must approve) |
| `/app/:householdId` | HouseholdLayout → AppPage | Finance app (כספים) |
| `/app/:householdId/home` | HouseholdLayout → HouseholdPage | Tasks + shopping (ניהול משק בית) |
| `/app/:householdId/calendar` | HouseholdLayout → CalendarPage | Shared household calendar (יומן משותף) |

## What's Built
- ✅ Multi-household support with invite links + owner approval flow
- ✅ Real-time sync (Firebase onValue listeners)
- ✅ Hebrew (RTL) + English (LTR) i18n
- ✅ Per-user color theming
- ✅ Dynamic per-household categories — add/edit/delete via Settings modal; seeded from 19 defaults on first load; emoji picker (curated ~70 emojis grouped by theme)
- ✅ Recurring charges (auto-apply monthly)
- ✅ Audit logs with diff tracking
- ✅ Online presence tracking (green/gray dots in AppHeader)
- ✅ Owner controls: rename, expenses-only mode, participant management
- ✅ Income privacy per member (client-side filter)
- ✅ Join request flow: JoinPage collects nameHe/nameEn → bell notification → approve auto-creates member card
- ✅ Bilingual member names (he + en); created on household creation + join approval
- ✅ Delete member (cascades) + Leave household + Delete household
- ✅ Membership guard (redirects if removed mid-session)
- ✅ Create household modal (DashboardPage, side-by-side name fields)
- ✅ AddMemberModal via pills ＋ button — custom validation (no browser popup): required fields, Hebrew/English character-set enforcement, duplicate name check; red border + field-error message
- ✅ TransactionView — unified expense/income form+list (replaces separate ExpensesView/IncomeView); custom validation on desc (required), amount (>0), category (required); red border + field-error messages
- ✅ Landing page with locale-aware screenshots
- ✅ Home module: Kanban tasks (dnd-kit, 3 columns: לבצע/בתהליך/בוצע) + shopping list
- ✅ Settings + Logs modals (scrollable ap-modal-body pattern)
- ✅ Shared calendar: monthly grid, multi-day events, participants tagging, recurring, EventModal (create/edit/delete)

## Automation — Google Wallet → HomeFine
- ✅ Cloudflare Worker webhook (`worker/`) — receives Google Wallet push notifications via MacroDroid and writes transactions to Firebase
- ✅ Parser (`worker/src/parser.ts`) — parses Google Wallet notification format: title `"MERCHANT  D/M/YY"` + body `"₪amount with CardName ••1289"`
- ✅ `webhookKeys/{apiKey}` Firebase path — reverse lookup (uid, householdId, memberId). No client-read.
- ✅ `userPrefs/{uid}/webhookConfigs/{householdId}` — **per-household** config (apiKey, householdId, memberId, lastPingedAt)
- ✅ Automation UI in SettingsView — connection status (🟢/⚪), `.mdr` download, test button, subtle "כבה אוטומציה" link. No URL/key display (baked into .mdr). Android only.
- ✅ `.mdr` download — generates a **single** MacroDroid macro with one trigger + one HTTP action per configured household. Fetches all `userPrefs/{uid}/webhookConfigs` at download time — no matter which household you download from, you always get the complete multi-household macro (`HomeFine_Wallet.mdr`). Re-import replaces the old macro.
- ✅ `lastPingedAt` — worker writes timestamp on every valid request; UI shows 🟢/⚪ connection status
- ✅ Test Connection button — sends ₪1 test transaction from within the app
- ✅ `VITE_WEBHOOK_URL` — `https://homefine-webhook.homefine.workers.dev`
- ✅ `webhookDebug` Firebase path — worker writes `{title, body, ts, error}` on parse failure; owner-readable; useful for diagnosing 422 errors without terminal
- ✅ Parser regex — accepts any non-digit separator before card last-4 (handles both `••` and `..` and other variants)
- ✅ MacroDroid variable format — must use `{not_title}` and `{notification}` (inserted via `...` button), NOT `%%ntitle%%`/`%%ntbody%%` (those are not substituted in HTTP body)

### Deploying the Worker
```bash
cd worker
npm install
wrangler login                               # one-time
wrangler secret put FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL    # from service account JSON
wrangler secret put FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY     # from service account JSON
wrangler deploy
# → note the deployed URL, set it as VITE_WEBHOOK_URL in .env
```
Service account: Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate new private key

### Future migration to Firebase Blaze
All the Firebase Functions code is already written in `functions/` — it's a drop-in replacement.
Steps when ready:
1. Upgrade Firebase project to Blaze plan (pay-as-you-go, free tier covers personal use)
2. `firebase deploy --only functions`
3. Update `VITE_WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env` to `https://europe-west1-homefine-a7613.cloudfunctions.net/smsWebhook`
4. Rebuild + redeploy frontend
5. Can delete `worker/` after confirming

## What's Planned / Not Yet Built
- ❌ Super Admin panel
- ❌ Viewer role (read-only member)
- ❌ Server-side income privacy
